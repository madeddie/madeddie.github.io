Where every company with a presence on the internet used to have real servers, i.e. actual hardware, these days offloading the work to clusters and using virtualised hardware is rapidly becoming the standard. In this relative new field knowledge and useful advice are scarce. Madtech is specialised in creating hosting and loadbalancing solutions.

Next to advice and consultancy, we offer hosting of websites, DNS and mail. Running primarily on Open Source solutions we are fully industry standards compliant and are able to accomodate very specific wishes.

For information about what services we could offer you, mail us at info at madtech dot cx
